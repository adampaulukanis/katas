Fizz Buzz

Players generally sit in a circle. The player designated to go first says the
number "1", and the players then count upwards in turn. However, any number
divisible by three is replaced by the word fizz and any number divisible by five
by the word buzz. Numbers divisible by 15 become fizz buzz. A player who
hesitates or makes a mistake is eliminated from the game.
