Test if all characters in a string are unique

Let's imagine we have strings we want to test:

string1 = "I am Adam"
string2 = "cute dog"

The first string contains the character *a* at least two times (three if counting *A*). This is why it should fail our
test.

String number two has no duplicate characters, and should pass our test.
